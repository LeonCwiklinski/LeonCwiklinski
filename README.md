Hello, My name is Leon Cwiklinski.

I'm a 16 year old student hevily interested in Mechatronics, Robotics and Engineering, especially Aerospace Engineering and Mechanical Engineering.

I'm currently learning C++ programming, advanced modelling in SolidWorks and math for stuff like inverse kinematics, PID's or Kalman Filters.

I'm looking to collaborate on literally anything but the closer it is to anything mentioned above the better it is.

You can reach me via my e-mail leoncwk7@gmail.com or discord _leonardo__ (its underscore leonardo underscore underscore), I respond to discord DM's very quickly.
